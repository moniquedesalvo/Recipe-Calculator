# meal_shrinker
Under construction: 
I have a lot of refactoring to do! At the moment it just cuts recipe ingredients in half but I'm planning to add much more and probably change the name from "meal shrinker" to something else, since shrinking a recipe is more of a limited scope than I'm hoping to acheive.:)
