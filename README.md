# recipe calculator
Under construction: 
I have a lot of refactoring to do! I'm also planning to add much more functionality and fix issues. For now it just cuts ingredients of a recipe in half but can't handle metric measurements just yet.

To use, create a file called recipe.txt in the same folder as this file is saved. Add your ingredients and save. 
Run in Terminal or Sublime.
